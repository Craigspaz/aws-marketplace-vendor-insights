Security Hub/Cloud watch :  
Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for AWS Config configuration changes.
 Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for CloudTrail configuration changes.

Perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail with prescribed metric filters and alarms configured:
  1. Identify the log group name configured for use with active multi-region CloudTrail:   
List all CloudTrail(s): aws cloudtrail describe-trails   
Identify Multi region Cloudtrails: Trails with ""IsMultiRegionTrail"" set to true 
  From value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn note  cloudtrail_log_group_name  
  Example: for CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn that looks like arn:aws:logs: region : aws_account_number :log-group:NewGroup:*,  cloudtrail_log_group_name  would be NewGroup   
Ensure Identified Multi region CloudTrail is active   
aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name  Name of a Multi-region CloudTrail  
ensure IsLogging is set to TRUE   Ensure identified Multi-region Cloudtrail captures all Management Events
aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name  trailname shown in describe-trails  Ensure there is at least one Event Selector for a Trail with IncludeManagementEvents set to true and ReadWriteType set to All 
2. Get a list of all associated metric filters for this  cloudtrail_log_group_name : aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name "" cloudtrail_log_group_name ""   
3. Ensure the output from the above command contains the following: ""filterPattern"": ""{ ($.eventName = CreateTrail) || ($.eventName = UpdateTrail) || ($.eventName = DeleteTrail) || ($.eventName = StartLogging) || ($.eventName = StopLogging) }"" 
4. Note the  cloudtrail_cfg_changes_metric  value associated with the filterPattern found in step 3. 
  5. Get a list of CloudWatch alarms and filter on the  cloudtrail_cfg_changes_metric  captured in step 4. aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName== ` cloudtrail_cfg_changes_metric `]'   
6. Note the AlarmActions value - this will provide the SNS topic ARN value. 
  7. Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn  sns_topic_arn 
   at least one subscription should have ""SubscriptionArn"" with valid aws ARN. Example of valid ""SubscriptionArn"": ""arn:aws:sns: region : aws_account_number : SnsTopicName : SubscriptionID ""
